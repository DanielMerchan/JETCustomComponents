>*: These property values explained in the following sub-sections

### Property - Modules
QuillJS Modules can be configured through the **modules** property which expects a JSON as explained in Quill JS - Modules documentation: https://quilljs.com/docs/modules/

Example:
```json
{
	"syntax": true,
	"history": {
	      "delay": 2000,
	      "maxStack": 500,
	      "userOnly": true
    }
} 
```
**Toolbar** module is NOT SUPPORTED as it is pre-configure within the Web Component. You can configure the Toolbar by using **toolbar-options** and 
>Note: 0.0.2 - Only accepts 'syntax' and 'history'. Other modules will be supported in later releases
### Property - Formats
It described which formats are allowed / denied of the Rich Text Editor. 
Check https://quilljs.com/docs/formats/ for possible values

```javascript
["background","bold","color","font","code","italic","link","size","strike",
"script","underline","blockquote","header","indent",
"list","align","direction","code-block","image","video"]
```

**Note**: This does not mean they will be rendered or not, this is controlled via **toolbar-options** property

### Property - ToolbarOptions
This Web Component uses the **Toolbar Module** of Quill JS for rendering the toolbar options allowed: https://quilljs.com/docs/modules/toolbar/
The possible values are:
```javascript
["font","size","bold","underline","italic","strikethrough","color",
"background","sub-script","super-script","header",
"blockquoute","code-block","indent","list",
"align","direction","formula","video","image","link","clean"]

</ojc-rte-quill>
```
```javascript
const editor = document.getElementById('editor');
console.log(editor.getHTML());
```

### Quill JS API
The Web Component proxy some of the official Quill JS Content API 
https://quilljs.com/docs/api/#content
>Note: Check component.json for more details of the methods of the API exposed
 
 **In future releases Formatting and other API will be exposed too**

## Events
The following events of Quill JS are exposed: https://quilljs.com/docs/api/#events
### ojc-text-change
Emitted when the contents of Quill have changed. Details of the change, representation of the editor contents before the change, along with the source of the change are provided.

The changesa are provided in Quill.Delta: https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/

```html
<ojc-rte-quill  id="editor" on-ojc-text-change="[[handleTextChange]]">
</ojc-rte-quill>
```
```javascript
define([...,'ojc-rte-quill/loader', ...], function(...) {
	function MyViewModel() {
	   var self = this;
	   self.handleTextChange = function(event) {
	      console.log(event.detail.value.delta);
	      console.log(event.detail.value.oldDelta);
	      console.log(event.detail.value.source);
	   }
	}
	return new MyViewModel();
})
```

### ojc-selection-change
Emitted when a user or API causes the selection to change, with a range representing the selection boundaries. A null range indicates selection loss (usually caused by loss of focus from the editor). You can also use this event as a focus change event by just checking if the emitted range is null or not.
```html
<ojc-rte-quill  id="editor" on-ojc-selection-change="[[handleSelectionChange]]">
</ojc-rte-quill>
```
```javascript
define([...,'ojc-rte-quill/loader', ...], function(...) {
	function MyViewModel() {
	   var self = this;
	   self.handleTextChange = function(event) {
		console.log(event.detail.value.oldRange);
		console.log(event.detail.value.range);
		console.log(event.detail.value.source);
	   }
	}
	return new MyViewModel();
})
```

### ojc-editor-change
Emitted when either text-change or selection-change would be emitted, even when the source is "silent". The first parameter is the event name, either text-change or selection-change, followed by the arguments normally passed to those respective handlers.
```html
<ojc-rte-quill  id="editor" on-ojc-editor-change="[[handleEditorChange]]">
</ojc-rte-quill>
```
```javascript
define([...,'ojc-rte-quill/loader', ...], function(...) {
	function MyViewModel() {
	   var self = this;
	   self.handleEditorChange = function(event) {
	      console.log(event.detail.value.eventName);
          console.log("[on-ojc-editor-change]" + event.detail.value.args[0]);
          console.log("[on-ojc-editor-change]" + event.detail.value.args[1]);
          console.log("[on-ojc-editor-change]" + event.detail.value.args[2]);
	   }
	}
	return new MyViewModel();
})
```
